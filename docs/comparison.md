# Comparison: MySQL on VM vs Managed MySQL (Cloud SQL)

Personally, setting up MySQL on a virtual machine hands-on and gave me full control over the environment. I installed the MySQL server, edited the configuration file, modified the bind adress, created my own firewall rules, and managed everything directly in the terminal. Since there were a lot of steps that I had to do, the process took longer, but also allowed me to understand each stage better. Being able to troubleshoot issues directly on the VM, such as MySQL not accepting external connections, also made it feel more transparent and customizable. Overall, the VM set up felt very engaging, and I had already preferred the GCP platform overall in comparison to others.

Cloud SQL was quicker to configure in comparison to the virtual machine. There was a lot of less manual work involved since Google Cloud manages a lot of the default settings, network configuration, and reliability. I encountered less errors, and had my Python script connected almost instantly once I added the users and databases through the interface. In terms of time and consistently, I think the managed SQL would be more efficient. 

For a small student project or a learning environment, the virtual machine would be the better option because it gives a more depth perspective on how MySQL functions at a system level. If we prioritize efficiency, speed, and simplicity, I think the CloudSQL instance would be a preferred choice especially with HIPPA aligned work or production analysis. This is since it reduces a lot of manual work, manages backups automatically, and is usually stable without a lot of intervention.
